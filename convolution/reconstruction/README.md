# Reconstruction
This sample is taken from the following source:

*Chapter 9 - Signal Processing, Fundamentals of Computer Graphics - 4th Edition* by Marschner and Shirley

*Reconstruction* is the process of taking a discrete sequence and making it continuous by applying a continuous
filter to it. This is most valuable when paired with *sampling*: taking a continuous function and discretizing
it; in a real-world application you may have sampled a song and stored it in a discrete format, and want to
replay the song by reconstructing it.
