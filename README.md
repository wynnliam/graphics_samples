# Graphics Samples
A pile of scripts and programs demonstrating various Graphics/GPU algorithms or ideas.
I will try my best to make these as intuitive as possible. The hope is that this can
be used for learning various concepts.

These samples will primarily be from the following sources:
* *Fundamentals of Computer Graphics - 4th Edition* by Steve Marschner and Peter Shirley
* *Real-Time Rendering - 4th Edition* by Tomas Akenine-Moller, Eric Haines, Naty Hoffman, Angelo Pesce, Michal Iwanicki, and Sebastien Hillaire

As well as the sources these texts cite. From whererever I get algorithms or concepts, I will
do my best to cite them. I will also try to place each concept in seperate, self-contained folders,
each with their own README's. I hope you find this enjoyable and useful!
